# Deflate - Recap

In this document, I want to give you an easy accessible reference sheet for Deflate. Included are all different block type specifications, all pre-defined Huffman codebooks, and all lookup tables, and the order of "codelen" lengths that is specified for the Dynamic Huffman compressed block in RFC1951.

Additionally, in this document you will find at the bottom the reference to - in my opinion - the best Deflate implementation written in C. I provide you instructive hints that enable you to navigate and understand the rather complex codebase more easily. I hope you have fun!
