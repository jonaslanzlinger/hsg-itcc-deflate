# Huffman coding - Resources

In this short document, I want you to point at useful resources concerning the Huffman coding, including canonical Huffman coding.

## Resources

* [Huffman Codes - Best explanation](https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~yye/c343-2019/huffman.php): For an easy to understand explanation of building Huffman trees and the corresponding codebook, including encoding and decoding, go here.
* [Huffman Tree - Visualization](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/DS/Huffman.html): Here you can find a nice tool that visualizes the construction of a generic Huffman tree of the provided input string. <b>Hint</b>: Lower the visualization speed, to see the descriptions of each step. <b>Note</b>: This tool is omitting the step of bringing the occurances in an ascending order.
* [Canonical Huffman Coding - Example + Implementation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/canonical-huffman-coding/): Go here for an examplatory run-through of how to build canonical Huffman trees. You'll additionally find a C-implementation at the end.
* [Canonical Huffman Coding - Implementation](https://medium.com/@vishalkhanna/text-compression-using-canonical-huffman-coding-c580a886837b): A nice implementation. Find link to GitHub further down below on Medium.
* [Hans Wennborg - The deflate whisperer](https://www.hanshq.net/zip.html): Go here, if you are most interested in how Huffman coding is adapted for the deflate algorithm.
